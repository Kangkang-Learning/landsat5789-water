# **landsat578-water**
A tutorial about deep learning of the surface water features on the Landsat-5, -7 and -8 images.
### **Objectives**
1. To complete the high-quality data labeling for 100 landsat images.
2. Skillful in using at least 2 classical deep semantic segmentation models
3. To achieve high accuracy (oa/miou) over 90% in the surface water mapping.
### **Image labeling in process**
Distribution of the labeled landsat images are below:
